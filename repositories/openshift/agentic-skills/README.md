# Agentic OpenShift Skills

[Red Hat OpenShift Lightspeed][docs] is a generative AI service that helps developers and administrators solve problems by providing context-aware recommendations for OpenShift Container Platform.
This repository contains skills ([open format][agent-skills], [Claude Skills][claude-skills], [OpenAI Skills][openai-skills]) maintained by OpenShift maintainers, which are designed to help agents with OpenShift activities.

[`Containerfile`](Containerfile) builds a container image with the skills.
OpenShift policy does not currently allow `FROM scratch` images, so we're just using the stock `FROM` base image that we use with other OpenShift images.
The resulting image can be [mounted as an image volume with a `subPath`][image-volume-sub-path] into any container that wishes to consume the skills.
